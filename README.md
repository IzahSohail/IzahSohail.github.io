# NYU Films 
NYU Films is a fictional film studio website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This repository contains the source code and assets for the website.

## Process
The process of creating NYU Films involved the following steps:

Conceptualization: I started by brainstorming the concept for NYU Films. I wanted to create a fictional film studio with a playful and imaginative theme.

Design: I designed the layout, color scheme, and overall aesthetic of the website on my iPad. I chose to use Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design.

Development: The website was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I implemented features such as navigation, video embedding, contact information and an "About us" section.

Testing: I tested the website across different web browsers and devices to ensure it functioned the same and looked great everywhere.

## Reflection/Evaluation

In creating NYU Films, my goal was to create and entertaining and immersive experience within the fictional world of the film studio. I believe I successfully achieved this by designing an engaging website that captures the essence of NYU Films.

Throughout the development process, I encountered challenges and explored different ways over overcoming these challenges that serve as crucial lessons about web design and development. My expectations and goals were met in terms of the website's functionality. I believe if I had more time, I could have done a better job on improving the overall aesthetic of the site.

I hope that users enjoy exploring the fictional film studio I have created and it's entirely fiction content.
